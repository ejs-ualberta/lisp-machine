!!!WARNING!!!

This code is not guaranteed to be good, correct, complete, or practical! Everything in here is experimental and there are a lot of things that could have been done better! In particular there are some poor programming practices in this repo because this is a personal project for fun and learning, nothing else. Including having minimal if any error handling. All the code in this repo (except for the gnu-efi code which is not mine) is under the GPLv3. This code is made for Linux so may not work on any other OS (specifically build.sh), and is not even guaranteed to work on somebody else's Linux box. You will need Clang to build this and qemu with ovmf or Virtualbox to run it, but there may be problems if you use Virtualbox. Specifically, for me it wouldn't boot on its own for some reason, but I could still run it from the EFI shell. On boot it will load the code in the kernel file and execute it. CALC (Computationally Annotated Lambda Calculus) is what I call the language it executes, as it is like lambda calculus but with choice when to evaluate a function.

Happy hacking! :)

P.S. How did you even find this lol
