Calling convention:
Caller allocates space on the stack for the return value.
Caller pushes params left to right onto stack (without touching sp)
All gp registers callee saved.
Callee saves fp, lr, and any registers it uses on its stack frame, then sets fp to point to its stack frame.
Do stuff.
Callee restores old fp, lr and pops everything (including its args) from the stack, and also returns a value on the stack. (it will be above sp)
